> This is a hands-on coding exercise designed to be completed within a limited timeframe.\
> Its primary goal is to facilitate discussion during a potential future interview.\
> We recommend allocating no more than 2 hours to this exercise, even if you're unable to fully complete the mandatory section.

## üìÑ Instructions

This exercise contains a mandatory part, the [Minimum Valuable Product](#-mvp).\
üö® MVP implementation should contain business logic; it is not just a handoff solution!

It's important to note that stories do not come with acceptance criteria; it's your responsibility to define them based on your functional analysis and understanding.\
üö® You must demonstrate that your solution meets the requirements outlined in the MVP.

Additionally, you have the opportunity to incorporate [Bonus Features](#-bonus-features) to demonstrate your ability to stand out and make the most of any remaining time.

**If you find yourself lacking certain information, please make a decision and ensure that your chosen approach remains consistent.**

### ‚õìÔ∏è Requirements

- Java 21
- `README.md` file ‚Äî _detail any intricacies within your implementation and provide instructions for launching your project_.
- Spring boot
- Angular

### üì¶ Delivery

The code must be accessible through this GitLab repository.\
üëâ Once you are done, please inform us via [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfg6oj8H2ie4GHHohisyeyNTXC8dm7BlbNf83kG4w3sOLEFLQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1473061203=mohammedtourab@gmail.com&entry.1365152005=SF-0300-AL01) üîö

### üìù Evaluation

**There is no single "correct" way to approach this exercise.**\
We are interested in your implementation choices, your techniques, code architecture, and adherence to constraints.\
The provided code must be **your own work**. You will be challenged on your implementation choices during the debrief interview.\
_Please also pay attention to the size of your commits and their messages._

### üí° Tip

To quickly establish your project's foundation, you can make use of [spring initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
